   PartC :
   
   Here we provide informations about the different file that compose our project
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 NB:                                                
                                                    
    1. we have installed Wmare Workstation 10 and Yosemite because none of us had a macbook, if you have one just skip the first three points of PartB and start from point 4. 
    2. If you are working on the mac mini provided by the professor,you will start as well from point 4.
    3. Our app has been made using Titanium Studio,but by June 30th 2015,there will be a migration to a new platform named "Appcelerator Studio",
       it should be verified if it's still possible to run our app on it.  
    4. a. In our Virtual machine,we have installed Yosemite + Xcode 6.2 + old and new versions of titanium sdk
       b. In the mac mini,it was installed Mavericks + Xcode 6.2 + old and new versions of titanium sdk
       everything works well in both cases after setting titanium sdk to the version 3.4.1
